// Written by: Michael Roffo
// Description: A simple flash-cards program with the following features:

// Challenges: Learning new Layout managers.
// Time Spent: 20 hours
// 
//                   Revision History
// Date:                   By:               Action:
// ---------------------------------------------------
// 11/16/17 (MR) moved graphics context from another file
// into a private class in this same file.
// runtime errors when using shape objects
// local to the paintComponent method...
// works fine but with sloppy static methods. argh.
// 12/1/17 (MR) lots of edits the last few weeks that I forgot to
// write formal revision reports for:
// CREATED POLYMORPHIC DRAW METHODS for different shapes. That works great.
// Used two nested for-loops to automatically update Font when new
//     font-family or font-style is selected from menus.
// Background of resultTextArea changes.
// Shapes automatically redraw when different shape is selected.
// 
// NOTE: JTEXTAREA DOESN'T SEEM TO SUPPORT COLORED FONTS?
// I WAS NOT AT ALL SURE HOW TO IMPLEMENT THAT PART OF THE ASSIGNMENT.
